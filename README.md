üìç Project Overview
This is a simple Raspberry Pi GPIO project that controls three LEDs (red, yellow, and green) using a push button and a buzzer. When the button is pressed, the lights change in sequence. If the red LED lights up, the buzzer is triggered to sound an alert.

The project is great for beginners learning how to use GPIO pins with Python, and it demonstrates basic digital input/output concepts.
